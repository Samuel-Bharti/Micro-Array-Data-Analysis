## Microarray Data Analysis

---

#### 1. A microarray is a laboratory tool used to detect the expression of thousands of genes at the same time. This repository contains the scripts for computational analysis of the expression data generated through microarray experiments.

#### 2. The repository discuss following techniques used for computational analysis of the microarray data -
- Data pre-processing
- Statistical Analysis
- Mechanistic Analysis
- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
- Network Analysis
- Visualizations
