## Microarray Data Analysis
---
A microarray is a laboratory tool used to detect the expression of thousands of genes at the same time. The advent of inexpensive microarray experiments created several specific bioinformatics challenges-
1. The multiple levels of replication in experimental design (Experimental design)
2. the number of platforms and independent groups and data format (Standardization)
3. the statistical treatment of the data (Data analysis);
4. mapping each probe to the mRNA transcript that it measures (Annotation)
5. the sheer volume of data and the ability to share it (Data warehousing)
